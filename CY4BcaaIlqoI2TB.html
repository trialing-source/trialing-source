Sometimes, the table gets "stuck" at what seems like a boundary area; for instance in this screenshot, "rental" is as far up and to the right as I can easily make it go:\r\n\r\n<img width="1183" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1443710/84795057-04131900-afc5-11ea-85fd-9f9530b5b7f3.png">\r\n\r\nA symptom of the problem is that the item stays selected and drags around through the window even when my mouse button isn\'t clicked; so in this case I clicked and dragged on the "rental" window, it got "stuck" in the upper right, then I let go of the mouse, and it still drags around with my cursor movement. Once a window is "captured" in this way, rapid mouse movement usually leaves the window where it was and very slow movement drags the window along with the cursor.\r\n\r\nAnother symptom is that, when the dragging problem is occurring, the cursor movements select text (such as the tabs across the top, or the words in the pop out menu, or in extreme cases even the database names in the navigation pane). \r\n\r\nThe problem is exacerbated by moving the mouse quickly while dragging, but isn\'t exclusively caused by that.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nGo to Designer, try to drag a few windows around.\r\n\r\nMove windows toward the upper third or right hand third of the available canvas.\r\n\r\nMove windows rapidly.\r\n\r\n### Server configuration\r\n\r\n- Operating system: Debian\r\n- Web server: Apache \r\n- Database version: MariaDB 10.3.22\r\n- PHP version: 7.4.6\r\n- phpMyAdmin version: QA_4_9, QA_5_0, master\r\n\r\n### Client configuration\r\n\r\n- Browser: Firefox 77, Chrome 83\r\n- Operating system: MacOS\r\n\r\n- Browser: Edge 44\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10'], ["As discussed [here](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/24975-handling-xhr-status-codes-globally), the handling of specific response status codes when doing client XHR requests cannot be currently extended.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to show a custom error message depending on the response properties. A possible use-case is to handle a situation where a WAF returned a browser challenge to a API request, and the user wouldn't notice and instead receive a generic error message.\r\n\r\nIt's probably not a common use-case, so this is low priority and maybe not even a breaking change, but still something that could be improved and that I would find useful."], ['Doing so should decrease the number of requests to fetch all details of an order.'], ["**Is your feature request related to a problem?

The search string you typed ("event") is still in the input box, and the first page of matching tables are still shown; therefore, the paginator should still be there. You should be able to see that the listed tables are only one of several pages, and you should be able to switch page\r\n\r\n### Observed behavior (as in "What actually happens because of the bug")\r\n\r\nAs soon as you choose one table in the subtree, the paginator vanishes. The string you typed is still shown in the input box, and the first page of matching tables is still shown in the subtree, but there is no indication whatsoever that there are more pages.\r\n\r\nWhich means two thing:\r\n- since you cannot be expected to remember everything you\'ve seen, you may have forgot that there were more than one page of tables matching your search. If you did, now there is no indication of that, so if you are going through all the tables to review something, you may get to the last displayed table and think that you have finished, while instead there are plenty more\r\n- if you do remember that there were more pages and want to continue to the next page, you cannot do that even by focusing the search box and hitting Enter, because that won\'t trigger a reload of the results. You have to actually delete the patial table name and type it again and hit enter (btw, hitting Enter is essential because of another pathetic bug where the results that are automatically loaded while typing are a random subset of actual results).\r\n- if you had followed the variant b and you were already at page 2, you are now in an inconsistent situation where it looks like the only matching results are those of page 2\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542107/93371911-634a2900-f853-11ea-8f61-a0102e668412.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542107/93371869-5299b300-f853-11ea-804e-dc64c6749028.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542107/93372010-92609a80-f853-11ea-91de-69ad8852e5a2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Server configuration\r\n\r\nWhatever the DEMO server configuration is (i.e. I assume the very latest) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Client configuration\r\n\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n'], ['| Q              | A\r\n| -------------- | ---\r\n| Bug?           | no\r\n| New Feature?   | enhancement\r\n| Version Used   | d1a281f \r\n| FFmpeg Version | ffmpeg version 3.4.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\r\n| OS             | Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nOn the example code\r\n```\r\n$format = new FFMpeg\\Format\\Video\\X264();\r\n$format->on(\'progress\', function ($video, $format, $percentage) {\r\n    echo "$percentage % transcoded";\r\n});\r\n```\r\nthe returned percentage is always returned as an integer.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior \r\nSince I plan to use the script on files that could take some time to convert, I need a percentage that is a little more precise, to calculate a litte more exact ETA, thus a float would be needed.\r\n\r\n#### Possible Solutions\r\nI already found out that you could replace \r\n`$this->percent = floor($percent * 100);`\r\nin the FFMpeg\\Format\\ProgressListener\\AbstractProgressListener with\r\n`$this->percent = round($percent * 100, 2, PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN);`\r\nHowever that would of course break on my end as soon as a new version of PHP-FFMpeg is released.\r\n\r\nI wondered, whether I either could extend the ProgressListener in any way, that it won\'t break after an update, or that the number of decimal digits for the progress percentage could be set via a function of the FFMpeg\\Format-class.\r\n'], ['According to documentation , I understand that I can host webscoket as one project(let\'s say "websocketproject.test") and I can connect it from another apps (projects, "mychatapp.test", "shopapp.test") for their own message and events.\r\n\r\nHow should I configure to achieve that ? \r\n\r\nDo I need to configure both host app and mychatapp ?

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen JavaScript is disabled or otherwise interrupted or not working, the noJS view of Flarum is just about good enough for reading forum posts. But it is very difficult to find anything. Filtering by tags, ordering and searching would help a lot with finding things but none of those features are available in the noJS view.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\'d like**\r\n\r\nI found that the result pages of filtering, ordering and searching already work without JavaScript. For example, https://discuss.flarum.org/?q=test shows search results for the search term "test" correctly when JS is disabled. The noJS view just misses the search box to trigger those results.\r\nThe same is true for filtering and ordering. The functionality is there, it\'s just that their respective triggering element is missing.\r\n\r\nI would propose to at least include a search box in the noJS view.\r\nIt would be the easiest to implement as it only needs a form that triggers a get request to the start page. And it would have the biggest impact out of those three features.\r\n\r\nFiltering by tag and ordering would obviously also be helpful. But those are probably more difficult to implement.\r\n\r\n**Justify why this feature belongs in Flarum\'s core, rather than in a third-party extension**\r\n\r\nI don\'t think it\'s possible to do that in an extension?

Which is basically everyone.)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\'ve considered**\r\n\r\nInitially I thought of having a search box that posts to Google. But because I then found that Flarum\'s search results work fine without JS, that wouldn\'t be necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a user the only alternative is using a search engine to search the forum.

Value can be either of \'icons\', \'text\' or \'both\'.\r\n\r\nI presume that "table row action segment" means the Edit/Copy/Delete buttons next to each row when browsing a table. But this option does not change those icons nor anything else I can see. A quick search through the code shows it being referenced in `DisplayResults::_getActionLinkContent` but I haven\'t figured out exactly when this piece of code gets executed.\r\n\r\nI also don\'t see this option anywhere in the Settings UI inside PMA.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe other option is `ActionLinksMode`:\r\n\r\n> If set to icons, will display icons instead of text for db and table properties links (like Browse, Select, Insert, …). Can be set to \'both\' if you want icons AND text. When set to text, will only show text.\r\n\r\nSo presumably this is for when you\'re at the Database level, looking at the list of tables. The option *does* apply to that, but also to the Browse/Structure tabs at the table level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo either `ActionLinksMode` is supposed to control all those icons, or it should only control some of them (e.g. Database Structure and Table Structure) with `RowActionType` controlling others (Table Browse).\r\n\r\nPersonally I\'d prefer the first, in which case the sample config should replace the old option with new.
